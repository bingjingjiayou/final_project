## Title

Differential Gene Expression in ICGC within Stage 2 Liver Cancer comparing high incidence age group and other age groups using DeSEQ2

## Author

Bingjing Zhang

## Overview of project

I will identify differentially expressed genes between Liver Cancer for high incidence age group and vs. other age groups. This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 and follow the specific vignette:http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html.For this analysis, I'll use the ICGC cohort and have identified 106 ht-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 41 high incidence age group and 65 other age groups.Within the analysis, I will control for gender and family history.
Vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html

## Data

I will use the data from https://dcc.icgc.org/search. Examining clinical data, there are 106 tumor samples, and 41 are defined by me as high incidence age group and 65 are identified as other age groups. The specific files are available are here [donor.tsv].

## Milestone 1

Due Date: Thursday November 11th

** Data fully loaded into vignette through HT-SEQ steps
** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.

## Milestone 2

Due Date: Tuesday November 23rd

An initial completion of vignette. I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback. Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.

## Deliverable

Due Date: December 3rd

A complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
