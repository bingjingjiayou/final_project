# Step 1:The processing data is in a format that can be analyzed by deseq2.

## 1，Download the data of phase II liver cancer patients from ICGC website. And upload to R, see documents Anno and Bnno.

## 2, Some of these data are selected, that is, whether the diagnosis age as the main variable is a high incidence period, covariate gender and family history. See documents Anno1 and Bnno1.

## 3, Because some patients in my data have been tested for many times and some have only been tested once, the data are processed and the first detection value is taken for analysis.

## 4, Adjust the length and width format, and turn donor_ ID becomes the first line. See Anno3.

## 5, Since my count data is the data of all patients, I based on 106 donors of phase II patients_ ID is used to merge the number of cases in count, and only the data of 106 patients are taken. And adjust the file to the file Anno9 that can be analyzed by deseq2.

# Step 2：Deseq2 analysis data

## 1, The processed data were analyzed with deseq2 to compare the expression differences of different genes in patients. According to the analysis results, there are 317 differential genes with P < 0.1, 252 differential genes with P < 0.05 and 171 differential genes with P < 0.05. See Figure P < 0.01.

## 2, Thus, the log2 multiple change plot MA1 of the average standardized count of all samples in a given variable can be obtained. And the plot ma2 diagram after eliminating the noise related to the log2 multiple change of low count genes. See MA1 and MA2.

 ## 3, Looking at the three normal distribution maps, we can see that the original adaptive distribution map is the best. See normal distribution diagram.

 ## 4, Check the reading count of a single gene across groups through the function plotcounts, specify the gene with the minimum p value, and make the following figure, as shown in Figure plot. It can be seen that there is no significant difference in the count of the minimum p value between the two groups.

## 5，Multifactor design: use the design formula containing additional variables to analyze the experiments with multiple factor influence counts, and analyze the log2 multiple change, P value and adjusted p value of variables other than the main variable.

## 6，Transform and visualize multivariable data. Firstly, the influence of transformation on square difference is analyzed, and three transformations are used, NTD, VSD and rld. The results show that the variance of rld transform is the smallest.

## 7,The data quality is evaluated by sample clustering and visualization, and the heat map of counting matrix is made. After analyzing various transformations to generate such heat maps, it can be seen from the previous data that my rld transformation variance is the smallest, so I only take the heat map generated by rld transformation.

## 8，At the same time, the heat map of sample to sample distance is generated.

## 9，The principal component diagram of the sample is generated, and the PCA diagram related to the distance matrix is obtained, which visualizes the gender and family history of the two covariates of the experiment.The following figure shows the PCA diagram customized by using the ggplot function.Firstly, comparing the difference between the first main variable（donor_age_at_diagnosis） and the first covariate（donor_sex）, we can see that there is no obvious grouping. It shows that there is no difference between the two variables.

## Then compare the difference between the second main variable（donor_age_at_diagnosis） and the second covariate（cancer_history_first_degree_relative）, and there is no obvious grouping. It shows that there is no difference between the two variables.
