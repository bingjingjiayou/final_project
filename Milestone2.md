# Section 1:Update

## The adjusted data have been analyzed by deseq expression difference analysis, and the expression difference map under the main variable has been obtained.

# Section 2: Next Steps

## Next, I will analyze the covariates, perform data transformations and visualization, and obtain the heat map of their count matrix. Because I have many invalid scripts for modification and deletion in the process of processing data, I will sort out the scripts and submit them.

# Section 3: Data.  Not due by Milestone 1, but I'll address.

# Section 4: Known Issues.

## First of all, I adjusted my data format, and only the first data is taken from the patient data tested many times. Second, because the adjusted data belongs to the list format, I adjusted the data type again. Third, this RNA count data includes all patients. I integrate it with the data of patients in the clinical stage I selected, and only retain the data of these patients I selected. In this process, operations such as row and column replacement are carried out. Fourth, compare the obtained data with the data containing clinical variables, and the patient IDs of the two tables are consistent.
